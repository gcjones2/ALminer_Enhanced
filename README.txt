Used ALminer to query ALMA archive given RA and DEC.

-Plots for each source:
  -Spatial distribution (w/ FoV, angular resolution) [FoV]
  -Spectral distribution (w/ emission line overlays and atmospheric transmission curves) [SpecCoverage]
  -Angular resolution vs. integration time for each line observation [LinePlots]
  -Expected continuum sensitivities as a function of frequency [ContCoverage]
-Table of line observations [LineTable.txt]
-Table of continuum observations [LineTable.txt]

Excludes mosaics, includes proprietary data.
