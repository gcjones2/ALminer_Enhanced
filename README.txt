Uses ALminer to query ALMA archive given RA, Dec, and redshift.

-Plots for each source:
  -Spatial distribution (w/ FoV, angular resolution)
  -Spectral distribution (w/ emission line overlays and atmospheric transmission curves)  
  -Angular resolution vs. integration time for each line observation
  -Expected continuum sensitivities as a function of frequency
-Table of line observations [LineTable.txt]
-Table of continuum observations [LineTable.txt]

Excludes mosaics, proprietary data.
